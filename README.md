# Laravel Big Data Processing into Database

This repository contains a Laravel-based solution for efficiently processing large datasets and storing them in a database. This process is designed to handle big data, ensuring data integrity and scalability.

## Features

- **Background Processing:** This solution leverages Laravel jobs to write data to the database in the background. If any jobs fail, they will be automatically retried. Even if the server is restarted, failed jobs won't duplicate data or require new requests.

- **Database Configuration:** To get started, configure your database. This project is optimized for use with PostgreSQL due to its speed and power.

- **Easy Setup:** Follow these steps to start processing your big data:

    1. **Database Configuration:** Configure your database settings in Laravel.
    
    2. **Migration:** Run the database migration command to set up the required tables.

    3. **Executable Script:** Grant execution permissions to the `start.sh` script. This script will start the server with all the necessary commands.

    4. **Run the Script:** Execute the following command to start the server:
    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```

    5. **Start Processing:** Your server should now be up and running. You are ready to process your data.

- **Data Ingestion:** Send a POST request with JSON data to `your-host/api/clients`. You can also monitor and analyze the stored data using PgAdmin or any PostgreSQL client.

## Scalability

- **Handling Larger Files:** What if the source file suddenly becomes 500 times larger? No problem. This process is designed to handle big data efficiently. It divides large files into smaller chunks, which are processed in the background.

- **Support for Multiple File Types:** The same code and process can be adapted to work with different file types such as XML or CSV with similar content.

This repository provides a robust, scalable, and versatile solution for processing big data with Laravel. Feel free to explore, contribute, or adapt it for your specific needs.
